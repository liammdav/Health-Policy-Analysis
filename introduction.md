# Health Policy Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my **Health Policy Analysis** portfolio! This collection showcases my **programming** and **data analysis** skills, with a particular focus on the application of **Python** to evaluate **health policy**. Key topics include **Medicare**, **health insurance markets**, **hospital financing**, and **patient affordability**.

As an **economics major** passionate about healthcare, I leverage my expertise in programming and econometrics to analyze complex health policy issues. Through this portfolio, I demonstrate my ability to process data, conduct econometric modeling, and visualize resultsâ€”all critical skills for assessing the economic effects of policy changes on healthcare systems.

Each project combines **realistic or simulated datasets** and rigorous analysis to explore the economic impacts of health policies. Using **Python 3** and tools like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Statsmodels**, and **Matplotlib**, I analyze topics such as Medicare expenditures, insurance enrollment trends, hospital financial health, and patient affordability.

## Projects:
- [Medicare Policy Impact Analysis](project_descriptions/medicare_policy_analysis.md)
- [Hospital Financing and Reimbursement Analysis](project_descriptions/hospital_financing_analysis.md)
- [Universal Healthcare Policy Simulation](project_descriptions/health_policy_simulation.md)

### Tools & Technologies:
- **Python 3** for data analysis and programming
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Statsmodels** for data manipulation and econometric modeling
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for interactive documentation and insights presentation

By working on these projects, I aim to apply **data science** and **economic modeling** techniques to health policy issues and provide clear, actionable insights from complex datasets.
